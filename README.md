Visual-Inertial Localization and Navigation Project for [Mobile Robotics Practicals at TUM](https://srl.cit.tum.de/teaching/w22/mobileroboticspracticals )

* Manual steering of an MAV in simulation (ROS/Gazebo) and the real world (via WiFi and ROS)
* Camera calibration
* Visual-Inertial localization system fusing IMU and camera data through EKF (simulation and real)
* Adopting dense volumetric mapping
* Implementation of a feedback-control architecture for autonomous MAV flight
* Integration of MAV motion planning and navigation algorithms (simulation and real)
* Completion of a Challenge: MAV flight through cluttered environment including automatic take-off and landing, and an open element to demo an element from Spatial AI, navigation, control
